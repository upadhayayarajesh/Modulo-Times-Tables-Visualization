I had done all of my coding in a single class main class of sample. I have created  three method imageCode(), firstScreen() and secondDcreen().
Before i see the lecure. i thought the favoriteimage is like a button and that will prompt to another screen and then there need to be some images.
I did the favourtie image option in that way. 
All of my logic, timer and most of my code is in first screen() method. For imageCode() method i have written a code for the image part that will 
return a Group with all the images. In ths first screen , i define some hbox, vbox, button ,label and textfield and then i added the buttton to hbox and
then added it to vbox and finally added vbox to rootcontairnrer scene. i draw a circle with 360 points. hen i added the line on it. i created an arrya of 10.
different colors and applied it to the cirle lines. and then, i added the timer. and for the favorite images.I need  to created another method screentwo 
for the back button on the favourite images.
